  This Implementation Guide is intended for insurers within the United States. Currently, many insurers make their formularies available to patients using PDFs or drug search forms through their websites. Providing formularies using FHIR may allow patients to more easily comparison-shop between plans and could help insurers educate consumers about the differences between various drug tiers/classes.
